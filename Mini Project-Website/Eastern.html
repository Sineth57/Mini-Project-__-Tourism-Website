            The Eastern Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. 
            The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to 
            the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.
             Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily merged with the Northern Province to form the North Eastern Province. The capital of the province is Trincomalee.

    <h2>1. Arugam Bay</h2>

    <p class="htp">
        <img class="hrtim" src="01 (1).jpg" style="float: right;">
        Arugam Bay, known locally as "Arugam Kudah", is situated on the Indian Ocean in the dry zone of Sri Lanka's southeast 
        coast, and a historic settlement of the ancient Batticaloa Territory (Mattakallappu Desam). The bay is located 117 kilometres 
        (73 mi) south of Batticaloa, 320 kilometres (200 mi) due east of Colombo, and approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of the market
         town of Pottuvil. The main settlement in the area, known locally as Ullae, is predominantly Muslim,[1] however there is a significant
          Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhala population to the south of the village, as well as a number of international expatriates, largely from 
          Europe and Australia.
          <br><br>
           While traditionally fishing has dominated the local economy, tourism has grown rapidly in the area in recent years.
            Arugam Kudah's literal Tamil translation is "Bay of Cynodon dactylon". Tourism in Arugam Bay is dominated by surf tourism,
             thanks to several quality breaks in the area, however tourists are also attracted by the local beaches, lagoons, historic temples 
             and the nearby Kumana National Park.

    During the period of fighting between the central government and Tamil separatists tourism was fairly low key and the hotels often bought 
    the catch of the fishermen. As a result of the peace, tourism expanded and many fishing people who had moved to areas less touched by 
    the conflict returned. Hotel owners began to complain about the smell of drying fish and how the fishing huts blocked their view.
     In the aftermath of the Tsunami fishing people were forbidden to return, officially on
    the grounds of safety but allegedly as a result of pressure from the hotel owners
    <br><br>
    The nearby (4 kilometres (2.5 mi)) Muslim village of Pottuvil is the center of commerce and transportation while tourist accommodations 
    lie along the beach to the south of Pottuvil Arugam Bay (4 kilometres (2.5 mi)) is also the gateway and the only road access to the Yala
     East National Park. In 2.2 kilometres (1.4 mi) distance there is Pasarichenai Beach. This area is known as Kumana (44 kilometres (27 mi)), 
     to be reached via the Tamil/Sinhalese settlement of Panama (Sri Lanka) (17 kilometres (11 mi)) and the Tamil shires at Okanda 
     (32 kilometres (20 mi)).
    The local area is home to a number of elephants, often travelling between Lahugala and Kumana national parks

        <img class="hrtim" src="Muhudu_Maha_Viharaya_(මුහුදු_මහා_විහාරය).jpg" style="float: right;">
        Muhudu Maha Vihara  is a Buddhist temple at Pottuvil in Ampara District, Eastern pro
        vince of Sri Lanka. This temple, near a wide beach, was built over 2000 years ago by K

         f King Kavan Tissa of the Rohana kingdom.According to the ancient chronicle Rajavaliya, it is stated that in the second century
          BC after Kelaniya was submerged by the sea due to a natural disaster, Devi the daughter of King of Kelaniya was cast to sea in a 
          Golden Vessel to appease the gods, and washed ashore near the Muhudu Maha Vihara in Pottuwil

    <h3>Muslim settlements</h3>
         <img class="hrtim3" src="A-visit-to-Muhudu-Maha-Viharaya-slider-3.jpg" style="float: right;">
        <p class="htp">
            In recent times the lands reserved for the temple have been forcibly taken over by Muslims with the alleged support of Muslim 
            politicians such as M. L. A. M Hizbullah. According to the Monks of temple as of 2019 out of the 72 acres of the temple 55 acres 
            have been forcibly taken over by Islamic extremists including those that are affiliated with the National Thowheeth Jama'ath.
             The road leading to the temple was renamed with the Arabic name "Masjithul  Palah Road" while Monks living in the temple had been 
             harmed and devotees harassed. Further several ruins including moonstones had been vandalised by Muslims.

            In August 2019 the National Movement of Sinhale staged a protest outside the ministry of Buddhasasana against the attack on a 
            Buddhist monk of the Muhudu Maha Viharaya. 
           <br><br> In May 2020 Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa directed defence officials to investigate the situation which resulted in 
           Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratna, Army Commander Shavendra Silva, Navy Commander Piyal De Silva, acting IGP C. D Wickremeratne
            touring the temple premises.
