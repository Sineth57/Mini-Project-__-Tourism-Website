            The Northern Province  is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. 
            The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the 
            Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. Between 1988 and 2006 the province was temporarily merged with the 
            Eastern Province to form the North Eastern Province. The capital of the province is Jaffna. T
            he majority of the Sri Lankan Civil War was played out in this province.

        <img class="hrtim" src="LK94009771-03-E-360-220.JPG" style="float: right;">
        Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil  is a significant Hindu temple, located in Nallur, Northern Province, Sri Lanka.
        The presiding deity is Lord Murugan in the form of the holy 'Vel' in the Sanctum, the primary shrine, and in other forms, namely, 
        Shanmugar, Muthukumaraswami, Valli Kaanthar with consorts Valli and 
        Deivayanai, and Thandayuthapani, sans consorts in secondary shrines in the temple.
    <br> <br>
    The original, Kandaswamy Temple was founded in 948 ad. According to the Yalpana Vaipava Malai, the temple was developed at the site in the 
    13th century by Buwanika Bahu, a minister to the King of Kotte. Sapumal Kumaraya (also known as Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), 
    who ruled the Jaffna kingdom on behalf of the Kotte kingdom is credited with building the third Nallur Kandaswamy temple.
     Nallur served as the capital of the Jaffna kings, with the royal palace situated very close to the temple.
    Nallur was built with four entrances with gates. There were two main roadways and four temples at the four gateways

    The present rebuilt temple that exists now does not match their original locations which instead are occupied by churches erected by 
    the Portuguese.The center of the city was Muthirai Santhai (market place) and was surrounded by a square fortification around it.
     There were courtly buildings for the kings, Brahmin priests, soldiers, and other service providers.
     The old Kandaswamy temple functioned as a defensive fort with high walls.
      In general, the city was laid out like the traditional temple town according to Hindu traditions.
       Cankilian Thoppu, the facade of the palace of King Cankili II, can still be found in Nallur.
       The third temple was destroyed by the Portuguese Catholic colonial Filipe de Oliveira in 1624 AD. The original kovil was located where 
       St. James' Church, Nallur is located today.

        Mannar is known for its baobab trees and for its fort, built by the Portuguese in 1560 and taken by the Dutch in 1658 and rebuilt
         its ramparts and bastions are intact, though the interior is largely destroyed.

        <br><br>
    Visually, the modern town is dominated by its churches, Hindu temples and mosques. The Catholic Church has a diocese headquartered in the 
    town. By rail the town is connected to the rest of Sri Lanka by the Mannar Line. It was occupied by LTTE during Sri Lankan Civil War b
    etween 1983 and 2009.

            <img class="hrtim" src="Lighthouse,_Talaimannar.jpg" style="float: right;">
           The island contains the main town of Mannar, and visitors can also head to Keeri Beach, the Talaimannar Lighthouse, the 700-year-old 
           Baobab Tree, and Mannar Fort. There’s plenty to visit, and Mannar Island is a must-see for those wishing to explore Sri Lanka’s 
           northern shores.
           Mannar Island and all that it has to offer is best enjoyed between July and September, and between the months of December and February.
            The weather in the northern parts of Sri Lanka can get extremely hot, so it is best avoided during the summer period between April and
             June.
           <br><br>
           The island consists of approximately 125 square kilometers of land, the majority of which features large expanses of white sand and palm t
           rees. There are also forests of palmyra palm trees that house several tribes of monkeys near the beach; visitors should therefore take
            caution not to leave food lying around.
