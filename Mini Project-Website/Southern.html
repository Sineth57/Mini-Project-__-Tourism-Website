    Galle was known as Gimhathiththa before the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, when it was the main port on the island. 
    Ibn Batuta, a Moroccan Berber Muslim traveller in the 14th century, referred to it as Qali.Galle reached the height of its development 
    in the 18th century, during the Dutch colonial period.
      
    <br><br>
    Galle is the best example of a fortified city built by the Portuguese in South and Southeast Asia, showing the interaction between 
    Portuguese architectural styles and native traditions. The city was extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 
    1649 onwards. The Galle fort is a world heritage site and is the largest remaining fortress in Asia built by European occupiers.

     <h2>3. Sinharaja Forest Reserve  </h2>
     <p class="htp">
        <img class="hrtim" src="20160128_Sri_Lanka_4132_Sinharaja_Forest_Preserve_sRGB_(25674474901).jpg" style="float: right;">
        Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is of international significance and has 
        been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

    According to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical 
    rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. 50% of Sri Lankan's endemics species of animals 
    (especially butterfly, amphibians, birds, snakes and fish species). It is home to 95% endemic birds.

    The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its
     inaccessibility, and was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.

        <br>
        Because of the dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as at dry-zone national parks such as Yala. There are about 3
         elephants, and 15 or so[vague] leopards. The most common larger mammal is the endemic purple-faced langur.
        <br><br>
        <img class="hrtim" src="site_0405_0001-1200-630-20150608104702.jpg" style="float: right;">
        Birds tend to move in mixed feeding flocks, invariably led by the fearless Sri Lanka Crested Drongo and the noisy orange-billed 
        babbler. Of Sri Lanka's 26 endemic birds, the 20 rainforest species all occur here, including the elusive red-faced malkoha, 
        green-billed coucal and Sri Lanka blue magpie.

    Reptiles include the endemic green pit viper and hump-nosed vipers, and there are a large variety of amphibians, especially tree frogs.
     Invertebrates include the endemic Sri Lankan birdwing butterfly and leeches.


        <br><br>
        The reserve is well-integrated with the local population who live in some dozens of villages dotted along the border.
         The villages are more in number along the southern border whilst the presence of some large estates along the northern
          border has resulted in only a few villages there. The locals collect herbal medicine, edible fruits, nuts, mushroo
          ms, other non-timber forest products including bees honey and a sugary sap collected from a local palm species of the gen
          us Caryota. The sap is converted into jaggery, a local brew and vinegar. Local people walk in the forest to collect the ab
          ove items when they are not busy with their other agricultural pursuits.
