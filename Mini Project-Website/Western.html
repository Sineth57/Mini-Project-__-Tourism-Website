            The Western Province is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country.
             The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the 
             Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. The province is the most densely populated province in the country 
             and is home to the legislative capital Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as well to Colombo, the nation's administrative and business
              center.

    This Buddhist temple includes several imposing buildings and is situated not far from the placid waters of Beira Lake on a plot 
    of land that was originally a small hermitage on a piece of marshy land.
    <br><br>

    It has the main features of a Vihara (temple), the Cet
    iya (Pagada) the Bodhitree, the Vihara Mandiraya, the Seema malaka (assembly hall for monks) and the Relic Chamber. In addition, a 
    museum, a library, a residential hall, a three storeyed Pirivena, educational halls and an alms hall are also on the premises.

    Don Bastian (de Silva Jayasuriya Goonewardane, Mudaliyar), a 19th century shipping merch
    ant who was seeking suitable land to build a temple for the Matara Sri Dharmarama thero,
    bought a beautiful tract belonging to three Moors, and filled and prepared the land at great expense. T
    he land was bordered on two sides by the Moragoda Ela and the Pettigala Ela was used to build the temple, wh
    ich was subsequently named the Padawthota Gangaramaya Viharaya. 
 
     <br><br>
    The Mudaliyar, with the assistance of the people
    built a great 'Chaitya' (Dagaba) of 30 Riyans, and built a great decorative arch (thorana) and a 'Sandakada pahana
    modeled on the ones found at Anuradhapura, at the entrance to the temple. A 'Bo' sapling brought from the great S
    ri Maha Bhodiya in Anuradhapura, was planted with his own hands and nurtured. He also built a three-storied preaching hall, walls, 
    railings and the moat around the temple.

        living in the zoo since 2012 has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19
        Dehiwala Zoological Garden is one of the oldest zoological gardens in Asia. It has a substantial collection of worldwide animals.
         It is open all year long and can be reached by public transportation. Diversity of the zoo is indicated by the presence of an aquarium,
          walk through aviary, reptile house, butterfly garden and many small, dilapidated cages and enclosures, housing starving, bored animals,

         <img class="hrtim" src="unnamed (1).jpg" style="float: right;">

            The zoological garden has a small, but picturesque butterfly garden which is decorated with small shrubs, trees, creepers and small 
            streams. Internal temperature and humidity of the house is controlled by artificially created mist. The butterfly garden exhibits 30 
            
            species of butterflies with their all stages of life cycle for educational purposes.
            The zoo consists of diverse indigenous as well as foreign wildlife including mammals, reptiles, birds and fish, destined for a 
            horrible and torturous time spent. Every year the zoo exchanges some of its animals with other zoos worldwide to enlarge the diversity
            of its animals and introduce new species of animals as well.

            Dehiwala Zoo always trying to introduce new members to their animal collection to expand it. In 2008, 3 month old seal has been brought

     <h2>3. Colombo Fort </h2>
     <p class="htp">
        <img class="hrtim" src="unnamed (2).jpg" style="float: right;">
        Colombo  is the commercial capital and largest city of Sri Lanka by population. According to the Brookings Institution, Colombo 
        metropolitan area has a population of 5.6 million, in the Municipality. It is the financial centre of the island and a tourist destination.
         It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to the Greater Colombo area which includes Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, 
         the legislative capital of Sri Lanka and Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia. Colombo is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayawardenepura 
         Kotte is itself within the urban/suburban area of Colombo. It is also the administrative capital of the Western Province and the district
          capital of Colombo District. Colombo is a busy and vibrant city with a mixture of modern life, colonial buildings and monuments.
        <br><br>
        Due to its large harbour and its strategic position along the East–West sea trade routes, Colombo was known to ancient traders 2,000 years 
        ago. It was made the capital of the island when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815,
        and its status as capital was retained when the nation became independent in 1948. In 1978, when administrative functions were moved 
        to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Colombo was designated as the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.

        <br><br>
        <img class="hrtim" src="768x428-2.jpg" style="float: right;">
        Like many cities, Colombo's urban area extends well beyond the boundaries of a single local authority,
         encompassing other municipal and urban councils such as Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, Dehiwala Mount Lavinia Municipal 
         Council, Kolonnawa Urban Council, Kaduwela Municipal Council, and Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha.
          The main city is home to a majority of Sri Lanka's corporate offices, restaurants, and entertainment venues.
           Famous landmarks in Colombo include Galle Face Green, Viharamahadevi Park, Beira Lake, Colombo Racecourse, Planetarium, 
           University of Colombo, Mount Lavinia beach, Dehiwala Zoological Garden, Nelum Pokuna Theatre, Colombo Lotus Tower as well
            as the National Museum.


        <br><br>
        As Colombo possesses a natural harbour, it was known to Indian, Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab and Chinese traders over 2,000 years ago.
         Traveller Ibn Battuta who visited the island in the 14th century, referred to it as Kalanpu. Arabs, whose prime interests were trade,
          began to settle in Colombo around the 8th century AD mostly because the port helped their business by the way of controlling much of
           the trade between the Sinhalese kingdoms and the outside world. Their descendants now comprise the local Sri Lankan Moor community.
