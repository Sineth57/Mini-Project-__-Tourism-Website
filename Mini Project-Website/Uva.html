    <p class="htp">
        <img class="hrtim" src="Horton-Plains-National-Park1.jpg" style="float: right;">
        Horton Plains National Park is a national park in the central highlands of Sri Lanka that was designated in 1988. 
        It is located at an elevation of 2,100–2,300 m (6,900–7,500 ft) and encompasses montane grassland and cloud forest.
        It is rich in biodiversity and many species found here are endemic to the region. It is also a popular tourist destination and
        is situated 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from Ohiya, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the world-famous Ohiya Gap/Dondra Watch and 32 kilometres
        (20 mi) from Nuwara Eliya.

    The Horton Plains are the headwaters of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe.
    <br> <br>
    
    In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains (මහ එළිය තැන්න). Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. 
    The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan
    sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but 
    restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback is one of the major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a 
    natural phenomenon.

    The sheer precipice of World's End and Baker's Falls are among the tourist attractions of the park.
